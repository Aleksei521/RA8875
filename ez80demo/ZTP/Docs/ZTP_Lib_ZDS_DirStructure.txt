Directory structure for ZTP 2.5.0 Library release
=================================================

The ZTP library version 2.5.0 is integrated with ZDSII_eZ80Acclaim!_5.3.0 and 
is automatically installed by the ZDSII_eZ80Acclaim!_5.3.0 install program.

The default location of RZK and ZTP components is
C:\Zilog\ZDSII_eZ80Acclaim!_5.3.0\ZTP2.5.0
