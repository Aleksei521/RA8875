			ZTP Minimal Configurations.

The Demo project provides the mainmal configuration of the ZiLOG TCP/IP 
Software Suite. It includes only the RZK Core, Device drivers 
( UART & EMAC ),ZTP Core( ARP, IP, TCP, UDP) and applications protocols 
bootp/DHCP, DNS & Socket library.This Demo folder contains the project 
workspace for the minimal configuration on eZ80F91.

The details of the configuration are as below :

	RZK
Maximum number of message queues 		10
Maximum number of eventgroup			3
Maximum number of semaphore			10
Maximum number of software timer		4
Maximum number of partition			4
Maximum number of regions			2
Maximum number of region segment		50
Maximum number of device control blocks		12

UART0	device
EMAC	device


	ZTP
Maximum number of IP receive Buffers		5
Maximum number of TCP sockets			4
Maximum number of UDP sockets			2
TCP Receive buffer size				2048
TCP Send buffer size				2048
Maximum number of Ethernet interface		1
Maximum number of Serial interface		0
Maximum number of IP reassembly buffers		2
Maximum size of IP reassembly buffer		3100


This directory contains seven files 
1. RZK_Conf_Minimal.c  	   - This file contains the RZK settings for 
			      the above configurations.
2. ZTP_Conf_Minimal.c  	   - This file contains the minimal initializations
			      required.
3. ZTPConfig_Minimal.c 	   - This file contains the ZTP settings 
			      for the above configurations.
4. ZTPConfig_Minimal.h 	   - This file contains the ZTP settings 
			      for the above configurations.
5. Main.Minimal.c      	   - This file contains a simple TCP 
			      server socket demo.
6. MinimalDemoWindows.exe  - This is the corresponding windows side 
			      client executable for the demo.
7. MinimalDemoWindows.c	   - This is the corresponding windows side 
			      client program for the demo.



Q How to run the demo?


A In the Main.Minimal.c file, set appropriate values to the maximun buffer
  size (MAX_BUF_SIZE), the local Server port number(LocalPort), the number 
  of iterations(ITERATIONS). The default values of MAX_BUF_SIZE, local server
  port number(LocalPort) and the number of iterations(ITERATIONS) are, 1200,
  5000 and 20 respectively. There values are set in main.minimal.c. If the
  user wants to change these values, he can search for these variables and
  change their values. Note that these values must be entered when windows
  application(MinimalDemoWindows.exe) is executed to run the minimal 
  configuration demo.
  Build the project and download the code on to the target.
  The print on the console gives the values of the iterations, Server port 
  number and the buffer size that was configured earlier. The ZTP code 
  should be executed first. Then execute the MinimalDemoWindows.exe. Enter 
  the same values of the iterations, buffer size and the port number as 
  displayed on the ZTP console. 


Q How to convert the other platform projects to Minimal confioguration ?

A 1. Copy the .ZDSproj file to the Minimal Demo folder.
  2. Delete rtc_conf.c, DataPer_Conf.c, RZK_Conf.c, ZTPInit_Conf.c,  
     ZFS_Conf.c, main.c and ZTPConfig.c from the project.
  3. Add Main.Minimal.c, RZK_Conf_Minimal.c, ZTL_Conf_Minimal.c and 
     ZTPConfig_Minimal.c files to the project.
  4. In the project navigate to Project->Settings->C->Preprocessor->Preprocessor
     definations delete SNMP, RZKFS, & SHELL defines.
  5. In the project navigate to Project->Settings->Linker->General
     ->Object/Library module delete the settings and add the below settings


     ..\..\..\RZK\Bsp\eZ80\Lib\BSPeZ80F91.lib,..\..\..\RZK\Core\eZ80\Lib\RZKDebugPI.lib,
     ..\..\..\RZK\Core\eZ80\Lib\rzkez80F91.lib,..\..\..\RZK\FileSystem\eZ80\Lib\noFS.obj,
     ..\..\..\ZTP\ZTPCore\LIB\ZTPCore.lib,..\..\..\ZTP\Apps\IGMP\lib\noigmp.obj,
     ..\..\..\ZTP\Apps\RARP\lib\norarp.obj,..\..\..\ZTP\Apps\SNMP\Lib\nosnmp.obj,
     ..\..\..\ZTP\Apps\ppp\Lib\noppp.obj,..\..\..\ZTP\Apps\CommProtoLib\CommoProtoLib.lib
	
    Note: Add the appropriate BSPXXXXXx.lib and rzkxxxxxxx.lib


Q What is the footprint of the above configurations?

A As a rough guide when considering footprint, the following metrics were 
  obtained using the eZ80(R) Development Platform with the eZ80F91 Module 
  attached and  "RAM" configuration and were compiled using ZDSII-eZ80Acclaim!(TM) v4.11.0
  The below footprint figures are for the above mentioned configuration. 
  The RAM and ROM requirment vary with the the application.The RAM requirment is given is 
  only the static requirmant and there might be run time requirments as well.

  The static ROM requirment is around 90 KB
  The static RAM requirment is around 38 KB
