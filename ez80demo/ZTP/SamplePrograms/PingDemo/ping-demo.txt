How to use Ping() API
-----------------------------------------
The pingdemo demonstrates the usage of ping() API.

The syntax of ping() API is,
byte ping(UINT32 dst, UINT32 count);

An application can use the ping API to determine if a remote device is
using a specific IP address. The dst parameter specifies the IP address of
the device to which an ICMP Echo Request packet is sent. The ping
packets is sent count number of times.

The ping() API takes the IP address of target as the first argument and
the number of times the ping packet to be sent as the second argument.

The API waits for a response from the target device. If a response is
received, then TRUE is returned. If this API fails to receive a response,
then FALSE is returned.
